 ### ðŸ’¼ How This Project Will Help Me in a Real Accounting Job
 
- Doing this Sage 50 project helped me learn how accounting works in **real life**.

I also did **year-end adjusting entries and created financial reports**.
- This is the kind of work **many small and medium businesses do every month**. So if I join as an accountant or accounting assistant, Iâ€™ll already know how to handle things like **payroll, journal entries, and remittances**. I also got used to working with Sage 50, which is a **common accounting software in Canada**.
- Thanks to my accounting course at **Seneca College** and the help of my **professor**, I feel more confident and ready to do these tasks **in a real job**.
